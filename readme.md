# Attract 2.0 beta
Attract was originally developed during the production of [Tears of Steel](http://www.tearsofsteel.org/) and since then has been slowly improving to serve as a decent GTD application for CG/VFX movie makers. With Attract you can keep track of the shots of your production, group them in scenes, assign them to users and generate some useful stats about how many seconds of the film are complete or in progress.

## Technology
Attract is based on the CodeIgniter framework and makes use of a number of other frameworks and plugins for the front end (bootstrap, jQuery, Chosen, DataTables).

## Requirements
In order to use and install Attract you need to satisfy some basic requirements:

* Apache server
* PHP 5.1
* MySQL

## Install and Configure
Set the Apache DocumentRoot to the folder containing attract (the folder where this readme file is).
Eventually set a proper hostname if you are working locally - modify the `/etc/hosts` file and add something like:

```
127.0.0.1	attract
```

Visit `http://attract/install` and follow the installation instructions.

Attract was originally developed by Francesco Siddi ([@fsiddi](https://github.com/fsiddi)). Any contributor willing to help out and improve the software is welcome!
