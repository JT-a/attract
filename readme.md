# Attract
It attracts tasks and allows you to track them. A small tool for keeping life organized. A more intelligent text will come when the application will work.

## Installation
You need LAMP or MAMP configuration in order to run Attract. Once you have set up the environment, rename or make a copy of the file db.default.php and call it db.php. In this file you will insert the credentials to connect to your MySQL database. This is just a temporary solution that allows to work with the git checkout without committing a modified db.php every time.
