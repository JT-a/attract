# Attract
It attracts tasks and allows you to track them. A small tool for keeping life organized. A more intelligent text will come when the application will work.

## Installation
Everytime you run attract, it will look for a db.php file inside of the app folder. If the file does not exists it will redirect to the install procedure. In order for it to succeed, you only need to make sure that MySQL is running and a database called attract exists.
