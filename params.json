Any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nAs a first step download the latest version of Attract by picking up either the zip or tar.gz archive. Then copy it in a proper location where it's accessible to the Apache web server and set it up so that the Apache Root point to the `attract` folder.\r\n\r\n### Configure\r\nOnce this is done visit the `localhost` domain with the browser, and get informed that Attract is not installed (missing `db.php` file). Click on the link go get redirected to the install file.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAttract was originally developed by Francesco Siddi (@fsiddi). Any contributor willing to help out and improve the software is welcome!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Attract? Check out the"}
